This is the same as the usual .fcgi file[1] for using FastCGI with flup,
except that this one terminates itself when the .fcgi fileâ€™s modification
date changes. Assuming you have something[2] that restarts FastCGI processes
as needed (which you should anyway), this effectively allows you to reload
the application by just `touch`ing one file.
