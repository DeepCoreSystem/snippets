    WSGI MyIP
    ~~~~~~~~~
    
    A trivial WSGI application that tells you what IP address
    youâ€™re connecting from.
    
    Running as of this writing at http://myip.ep.io/ and http://ip.exyr.org/
    
    This was made just to try http://www.ep.io/ out. They use IPv6 so
    IPv4 addresses may look like ::ffff:127.0.0.1
